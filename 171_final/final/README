    Welcome!

    This tool is used to help visualize a set of MLB statistics from 1998 to 2023. These statistics make up the core of
    the MLB statistics that are important to know for an interested person in baseball statistics.

    After starting up the tool you will notice that the visualization starts on Wins. You can change this by toggling
    through the different tracked statistics in the dropdown.

    You will notice two buttons on the top to switch views. Firstly, the right most button
    "Offense View" toggles between advanced statistics of offense and defense in the form of regression line
    scatter plots. These can be filtered by year by clicking on the button with the starting value "1998" to sort
    through the years in the data set. These can also be filtered by the filter button if you want to look at a smaller
    selection.

    On the left is the button to toggle views between time and team. The visualization starts on the Team view which
    visualizes teams by a specific year. The other Time visualization visualizes a specific team over time. This also
    includes a visualization which allows you to compare different teams with each other. The filters now allow for the
    selection of team and a filtering of the years visualized.

    Disclaimer: This tool is not meant to be a fully comprehensive view of every statistic that exists in the MLB but is
    meant to be used as an intro into the various types of statistics that are tracked and can help separate winning and
    losing teams.
